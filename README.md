### Car Rental Service Application

This repository contains the codebase and documentation for our Car Rental Service Application project developed at Northeastern University. The project addresses the challenges faced by traditional car rental companies, aiming to provide users with a seamless and efficient car rental experience.

## Project Overview

More people are opting for car rentals, leading to increased demand. Traditional companies struggle to meet this demand, resulting in long wait times and complex rental procedures. Our solution is a user-friendly car rental application that simplifies the rental process, reduces wait times, and enhances the overall user experience.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate effortlessly through the application, whether on the website or mobile app.
- **Advanced Reservation:** Allow users to reserve cars in advance, reducing wait times at rental locations.
- **Wide Vehicle Selection:** Provide users with a diverse range of vehicles to choose from.
- **Transparent Pricing:** Display the complete cost upfront, eliminating surprises for users.
- **Secure Online Payments:** Ensure the safety and security of user payment information through a secure gateway.
- **24/7 Customer Support:** Users have access to customer support around the clock, enhancing assistance when needed.
- **Integration with External Services:** Interface with GPS tracking and insurance companies to provide additional services.
